status-board
============

This is a somewhat functional implementation of a Nagios status board based loosely upon Panic's Status Board.

It depends upon Nagios V-Shell (at least version 1.9) and will *definitely* require customisation to make it work in your environment.

One day, I'll make it pleasant to use.
